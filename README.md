About the RestHotelClient Project
---------------------------------
This is a simle demo of RESTful Web Services client that works with the RestHotel sample project. See the README file of that project for more information.

The app provides basic C.R.U.D. functionality and offers one custom search feature that lets you find hotels containing any substring. When running the app make sure you use a modern, HTML5 compliant web browser.

This is a Netbeans project (only) that runs on port 8383 using the Netbeans embedded server. However, a person could easily migrate the code to another IDE. However you must be careful to run it on a server port other than 8080.
